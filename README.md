# ResidenceStoreClient.js

This is a javascript client for a ResidenceStore based server.

## Installing

Just include the script in your page:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="Content/Scripts/residencestore.js"></script>

The script needs a few other scripts: jquery (1.8 would be fine) and a part of cryptojs (core-min and sha1):

    <script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/components/core-min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/sha1.js"></script>
